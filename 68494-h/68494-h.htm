<h2 id="toc" class="nobreak"><i>EXPLANATION OF VIEWS ILLUSTRATED</i></h2>

<h3><a href="#cover">MOUNT SHASTA FROM RESERVOIR LAKE (COVER)</a></h3>

<p>This is one of the most famous views of this imperial mountain peak.</p>

<div class="tb">      </div>

<h3><a href="#i_3">THE FERRY BUILDING</a></h3>

<p>From the Ferry Building, at the foot of Market Street, the ferry boats of the
Southern Pacific take the traveler across San Francisco Bay to Oakland Pier. The
Ferry Building, erected in 1896 at a cost of $1,000,000, is the water gate of San
Francisco, where rail and tide meet. There is scarcely a minute in the day when there
is not a ferry either arriving at or departing from some one of the ferry slips.</p>

<div class="tb">      </div>

<h3><a href="#i_4">VIEW OF SAN FRANCISCO, SHOWING THE HARBOR, OAKLAND,
AND MOUNT DIABLO IN THE DISTANCE</a></h3>

<p>San Francisco, the starting point of this journey, is the largest and best known
of the cities on the Pacific Coast. This bird’s eye view of lower San Francisco, the
Ferry Building and San Francisco Bay, shows the splendid body of water facing the
city. This Bay is seventy miles long and from three to ten miles wide, and has an
area of four hundred and fifty square miles. Vessels of all descriptions, and from all
parts of the globe, populate San Francisco harbor, which is the pride and marvel of
all navigators. Yerba Buena Island is seen on the left, the trans-bay cities of Oakland,
Berkeley and Alameda, and ferryboat landings in the middle distance, while in the
distance is seen Mount Diablo.</p>

<div class="tb">      </div>

<h3><a href="#i_5">OAKLAND, CALIFORNIA</a></h3>

<p>Oakland, the third largest city in California is but eighteen minutes from San
Francisco via the Southern Pacific’s fine transbay steamers.</p>

<p>With its fine harbor facilities, Oakland is rapidly growing as a commercial center,
carrying on an extensive coastwise and foreign trade. Its position on the east side of
the bay, makes it a great railroad terminal for all lines from the north, south and east.</p>

<p>As a community of homes, Oakland has a well deserved fame, for its setting is
picturesque and the climate nears perfection.</p>

<p>Oakland has many attractive parks and public playgrounds. Lake Merritt, near
the Civic Center is a natural water-park, and state game reserve, where thousands of
wild ducks make their winter home, an unusual sight, indeed. Boating may be
enjoyed every day in the year.</p>

<p>Oakland’s City Hall, with its massive tower, is the tallest building in California,
its height being 377 feet.</p>

<div class="tb">      </div>

<h3><a href="#i_6">FERRY BOAT “CONTRA COSTA”</a></h3>

<p>This ferry carries Southern Pacific trains and passengers between Port Costa and
Benicia, crossing the Carquinez Straits. The distance is about a mile and requires
about twenty minutes. The ferry was constructed as a sister ship to the ferry “Solano”
and is the largest ferry in the world. It is 433 feet long, cost $450,000, and has a
capacity of 36 cars and two engines.</p>

<div class="tb">      </div>

<h3><a href="#i_7">LASSEN PEAK, LASSEN VOLCANIC NATIONAL PARK</a></h3>

<p>Lassen Peak, California, is the latest scene of volcanic activity on the Pacific
Coast, adding another point of interest along “The Road of a Thousand Wonders.”
Lassen Peak with its elevation of 10,577 feet, can be seen from the car windows of
the “Shasta Route” trains, and can be visited from Red Bluff or Redding by automobile.</p>

<div class="tb">      </div>

<h3><a href="#i_8">SACRAMENTO RIVER AND MT. SHASTA FROM CASTELLA</a></h3>

<p>This is one of the finest views in the canyon, with the mighty form of Mt. Shasta
in the background. The great white cap extends 14,444 feet above the sea. The
foothill counties tributary to this valley are rich in gold and other minerals, while
the rich soil of the entire valley is adapted to raising of a most diverse variety of crops.
The upper canyon of the Sacramento River constantly presents to the traveler an ever-changing
scene of astounding splendor.</p>

<div class="tb">      </div>

<h3><a href="#i_9">CASTLE CRAGS IN SACRAMENTO CANYON</a></h3>

<p>Castle Crags, in the Sacramento Canyon, are great granite rocks, rising close beside
the track, to a height of 4,000 feet. Their vertical strata splintered into a hundred
parapets, makes this a scene never to be forgotten. Beyond the Crags is Castle Lake
at an elevation of 7,245 feet, and from this point appears the rounded summit of Mt.
Shasta, silver against the turquoise sky; a watch tower of the world, gazing ever
toward the eternal.</p>

<div class="tb">      </div>

<h3><a href="#i_10">MOSSBRAE FALLS AT SHASTA SPRINGS</a></h3>

<p>Here one of the enormous streams which have their origin in the melting snows
of Mt. Shasta, divides itself into a myriad of little waterways before reaching the top
of a wooded semi-circular cliff, from which point it tumbles into the Sacramento
River, a hundred feet below, forming Mossbrae Falls, as they appear like a thousand
springs born under the rocky ground.</p>

<div class="tb">      </div>

<h3><a href="#i_11">SHASTA SPRINGS, CALIFORNIA</a></h3>

<p>Shasta Springs, near the base of Mount Shasta, is one of the best-known all-the-year-around
resorts in the world. Here the train stops long enough for a drink of
the famous sparkling Shasta water, real soda water. This resort is noted for its
scenic beauty and its health-giving water.</p>

<div class="tb">      </div>

<h3><a href="#i_12">CANTARA LOOP, 18TH CROSSING, SACRAMENTO RIVER, CALIFORNIA</a></h3>

<p>The train spends five hours crossing and recrossing the Sacramento River. This
loop was devised to get out of the canyon and up on the plateau where stands Mt.
Shasta, with its snowy summit, as seen from the car windows; nothing could be a more
glorious tribute to the marvelous skill of the modern railroad engineer, than the
obstacles met with and overcome in building a railroad through this rugged country.</p>

<div class="tb">      </div>

<h3><a href="#i_13">SISSON, AT THE BASE OF MOUNT SHASTA</a></h3>

<p>At this point the traveler finds himself at the base of the mountain, and if he
desires, can arrange a genuine Alpine mountain climbing trip. The town stands at
the base of the mountain and a road runs to the edge of the timber line, which has
made possible an ascent of the mountain in a single day. The wonderful view from
the summit, 14,444 feet above the sea, is bounded only by the curvature of the
world’s disc, and there is not a finer view to be had anywhere.</p>

<div class="tb">      </div>

<h3><a href="#i_14">PANORAMA OF MT. SHASTA AND BLACK BUTTE</a></h3>

<p>There are numerous volcanic cones scattered throughout this part of California.
One of the best-known is Black Butte, also called Muirs Peak. Its cone is almost
perpendicular to a height of almost 6,000 feet, close to the base of Mt. Shasta—black,
bare and desolate, an extinct volcano, with half a dozen craters in plain view. Mt.
Shasta is an extinct volcano, one of the highest peaks on the North American Continent.
Its snows and glaciers feed hundreds of streams which thread the wild region
in every direction. These wild regions are a paradise for the sportsman and lover of
nature. Grizzly, black and cinnamon bear abound, elk, deer and mountain sheep are
plenty, as well as a great variety of smaller game. The streams are alive with trout.</p>

<div class="tb">      </div>

<h3><a href="#i_15">MOUNT SHASTA FROM EDGEWOOD</a></h3>

<p>Here is one of the favorite view points of this great snow-capped mountain and
where the majestic grandeur of the mountain is most apparent. Edgewood, as the
name suggests, is literally the edge of the forest. From this point to the summit of
the Siskiyous there is very little timber.</p>

<div class="tb">      </div>

<h3><a href="#i_16">MT. McLOUGHLIN FROM UPPER KLAMATH LAKE</a></h3>

<p>The Klamath Country has no superior as a pleasure realm for the sportsman and
camper, and of unusual interest to tourists. Much of this region is still a wilderness,
full of the charm of mountain and forest. Its marches are breeding grounds for wild
fowl; its clear streams and broad lakes are full of lusty, hard-fighting trout, and in its
forests roam deer, bear and cougars. Mount McLoughlin, the highest peak in southern
Oregon, is 9,760 feet above sea level.</p>

<div class="tb">      </div>

<h3><a href="#i_17">WIZARD ISLAND, CRATER LAKE NATIONAL PARK</a></h3>

<p>Crater Lake lies in the heart of the Cascade Range, in southern Oregon, its surface
6,177 feet above sea level. As its name suggests, it is the crater of an extinct volcano.
Crater Lake has been sounded to a depth of 1,996 feet and declared by scientists to be
the deepest inland body of water in the world. Rising almost sheer from the water’s
edge, the rim of the lava cliffs attain at places a height of 2,000 feet. From Crater
Lake Lodge, on the rim of the lake, the opposite shore is six miles away. Wizard
Island is a perfectly preserved cinder cone rising nearly 1,000 feet above the lake.
You may climb the slaggy timbered cone of Wizard Island and descend one hundred
feet into its crater which is five hundred feet across.</p>

<div class="tb">      </div>

<h3><a href="#i_18">LOOP TUNNELS 14 AND 15 IN SISKIYOU MOUNTAINS</a></h3>

<p>This picture represents one of the difficulties of railroads through this rugged
mountain range and shows elevation is overcome by the use of tunnels. A tunnel
is cut through the rocks; a circuit is made leading back to the same point at a higher
elevation and another tunnel is cut directly over the first one. The traveler will find
this a most interesting view as the train winds its way through these mountains.</p>

<div class="tb">      </div>

<h3><a href="#i_19">GOLD RAY DAM, SHOWING TABLE MOUNTAIN AND ROGUE RIVER</a></h3>

<p>Table Rock is familiar in Indian history as the place where Captain Jack of the
Modoc Indians made his last stand; was captured and hung at Old Fort Klamath,
ending the historical Modoc war. Snow-capped Mt. Pitt, rising to an altitude of
9,760 feet, is visible from this point.</p>

<div class="tb">      </div>

<h3><a href="#i_20">HELL GATE, ROGUE RIVER</a></h3>

<p>This picture shows the character of the upper stretches of this splendid trout
stream. Anglers cross the continent for the joys of fishing this stream. The line of
the Shasta Route from Medford to Crater Lake follows this canyon and affords many
beautiful views.</p>

<div class="tb">      </div>

<h3><a href="#i_21">COW CREEK CANYON</a></h3>

<p>Despite its unromantic title, this canyon has few rivals in the attractiveness of its
scenery. For a long way, the tracks run parallel to the stream, which races in rapid
rivalry with the train. Its rugged walls on every hand form grotesque outlines, suggesting
weird figures to the imagination of a nature-loving mind.</p>

<div class="tb">      </div>

<h3><a href="#i_22">THE WILLIAMETTE RIVER, OREGON</a></h3>

<p>The Southern Pacific “Shasta Route” follows for 150 miles, the beautiful
Williamette River, and from the car windows, may be glimpsed views of its wooded
banks, its gleaming reaches and winding course that will delight the beholder. The
Williamette Valley through which it flows is the principal valley of Western Oregon.</p>

<div class="tb">      </div>

<h3><a href="#i_23">MOUNT HOOD FROM LOST LAKE</a></h3>

<p>This mountain is often spoken of as the “Pride of Oregon.” Its uppermost
peak reaches an altitude of 11,225 feet and is plainly visible from many points on
this part of “The Road of a Thousand Wonders.” While this grand mountain is
easy to climb, the ascent is steep and the alpenstock and rope are used to aid one in
his upward journey. On the top one finds a region of perpetual snow, but the view
is indescribably grand. The trip to the summit is one of the most popular trips out
of Portland.</p>

<div class="tb">      </div>

<h3><a href="#i_24">PORTLAND, OREGON. MOUNT HOOD IN DISTANCE</a></h3>

<p>Portland, often termed the “Rose City,” has many natural advantages and points
of interest to the traveler. This popular name is derived from the city’s beautiful
parks and homes, where roses are in abundance everywhere. A trip up the Columbia
River from Portland will leave an impression on the traveler never to be forgotten.
Mountain climbing and ocean bathing are popular sports that help to make Portland
a favorite stopping point.</p>
